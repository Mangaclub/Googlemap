 This is a sadly discontinued Component for Joomla displaying Googlemaps. 
 
 It supports KML and KMZ datasources, Shapes and overlays, Icons and html inside a map and is really easy to use.  
 
 Sadly it has been discontinued and vanished from the Internet as well this version has a XSS Volunerability and 
 needs to be updated Security wise and also to work with the latest version of Google map API.  
 
 I uploaded this now so that hopefully others may fix all those problems. 
 Till those are not fixed please do not install it.
